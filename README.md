This project addresses the challenge of uncertainty estimation in AI-drivenbird sound classification, essential for the ‚ÄùDeepBirdDetect‚Äù project aimed at harmonizing wind power expansion with avian conservation. We aim to evaluate methods such as Monte Carlo Dropout, Spectral-normalized Neural GaussianProcess, and Focal Loss within deep learning frameworks, assessing their performance across various neural network architectures, including CNNs and Trans-formers, and model scales. Our findings will provide insights into the suitability of these uncertainty estimation techniques for environmental conservation applications, offering a basis for more reliable and transparent AI-based wildlife monitoring.

## User Installation

The simplest way to install $\texttt{UncertainBird}$ is to clone this repository.

You can also use the [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) configured as as git submodule:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

And install python dependencies with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
```
poetry install

eval $(poetry env activate)
```


## Run experiments

Our experiments are defined in the `projects/UncertainBird/configs/experiment/` folder. To run an experiment, use the following command in the directory of the repository:

``` bash
./projects/UncertainBird/train.sh experiment="EXPERIMENT_PATH"
```

E.g.
``` bash
./projects/uncertainbird/train.sh experiment=resnet_esc50  
```

## Project structure

This repository is a fork of [BirdSet](https://github.com/DBD-research-group/BirdSet). All project related changes are made in the `projects/UncertainBird` folder. If you want to change or fixed a bug in the original code, please make a pull request to the original repository. You can use all configurations and scripts from the original repository. If you want to override the configurations add a file with the appropriate path in the `projects/UncertainBird/configs/` folder. Python code can be added in the `projects/UncertainBird/src` folder use the same folder structure as in `/birdset`.
